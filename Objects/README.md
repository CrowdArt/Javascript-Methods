# Javascript - OOP

* Encapsulation - the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.
* Aggregation - the capability to store one object inside another object.
* Inheritance - the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some 
    of its properties or methods.
* Polymorphism - the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of ways.

Objects are composed of attributes.  If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object.  Otherwise, the attribute is considered a property.
